        <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. <br>
           Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of Pleistocene wolves over 14,000 years ago. <br>
           The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, <br>
           which was before the development of agriculture.</p> <br>

        <h1 id="cat">Cat</h1>
        <img src="cat.png" alt="cat" height="225px">
        <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. <br>
           It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred <br>
           in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. <br>
           It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin.</p> <br>

        <h1 id="lion">lion</h1>
        <img src="LION.png" alt="lion" height="225px">
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. <br>
           It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. <br>
           It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. <br>
           A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</p> <br>

        <h1 id="horse">horse</h1>
        <img src="horse.png" alt="horse" height="225px">
        <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. <br>     
           It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. <br>                                                            
           The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, close to Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. <br>
           Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE.</p> <br>
