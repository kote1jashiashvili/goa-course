        <h1>what kote learned</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>html</h2>
            At the core of Kote's knowledge is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), <br>
            the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. <br>
            Kote learned that HTML defines the content of a web page, <br> 
            such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.
            <h2>css</h2>
            After mastering the structure, Kote moved <br>
            on to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which <br>
            controls the appearance of the HTML elements. <br> 
            As a programmer who began with HTML and CSS, <br>
            Kotes journey into styling web pages was both <br>
            exciting and challenging.<br>
