        Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum <br>
        Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC <br>
        programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception <br>
        handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] Its <br>
        implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole <br>
        responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July <br>
        2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities <br>
        as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL), a title the Python community <Br>
        bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief <br>
        decision-maker[44] (he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled <br>
        "BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected <br>
        a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46] <br>
