        pythons, are a family of nonvenomous snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia. <br>
        Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Ten genera and 39 <br>
        species are currently recognized. Being naturally non-venomous, pythons must <br>
        constrict their prey to induce cardiac arrest prior to consumption. Pythons will <br>
        typically strike at and bite their prey of choice to gain hold of it; they <br>
        then must use physical strength to constrict their prey, by coiling their <br>
        muscular bodies around the animal, effectively suffocating it before swallowing <br>
        whole. This is in stark contrast to venomous snakes such as the rattlesnake, <br>
        for example, which delivers a swift, venomous bite but releases, waiting as <br>
        the prey succumbs to envenomation before being consumed. Collectively, the <br>
        pythons are well-documented and studied as constrictors, much like other <br>
        non-venomous snakes, including the boas and even kingsnakes of the New World. <Br>
